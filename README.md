# fakeStore

Welcome to the fakeStore,
I have developed a store here for practicing. The aim was to process data from an API. The data should be sorted and filtered, it was important to get from a product card to the product details.
The focus here was on dynamic routing with the react router dom.

## Tech's:

- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- Tailwind
- react-router-dom
- [fakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
